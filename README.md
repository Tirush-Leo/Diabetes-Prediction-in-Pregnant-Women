# Diabetes Prediction in Pregnant Women

This project focuses on the application of machine learning techniques to predict the onset of diabetes in pregnant women, utilizing a dataset of health metrics. Early detection of diabetes during pregnancy is crucial for the health and well-being of both mother and child. By leveraging the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, this project aims to contribute to preventive health measures during pregnancy.

## Project Overview

Diabetes during pregnancy, also known as gestational diabetes, can pose significant risks if left undiagnosed. This project uses a structured dataset containing health information of pregnant women to train a model capable of predicting the likelihood of diabetes. The model is built using the SVM algorithm, renowned for its effectiveness in classification tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language for the project.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn:** For preprocessing data, splitting the dataset, and implementing the SVM algorithm.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises various health metrics relevant to diabetes diagnosis, such as glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, and more. Each entry is labeled as either diabetic or non-diabetic, serving as the foundation for training and testing the SVM model.

## Model Training and Evaluation

The project follows a systematic approach to data processing and model training:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Data is standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure that the SVM algorithm functions optimally. This step is crucial for handling variables measured at different scales.

2. **Model Training:** The SVM model with a linear kernel is trained on the standardized dataset. This model is chosen for its effectiveness in handling binary classification tasks.

3. **Evaluation:** Model performance is evaluated using accuracy scores for both training and testing sets, providing insights into the model's ability to generalize to new data.

4. **Prediction:** The trained model is then used to make predictions on new data, demonstrating its practical application in predicting diabetes in pregnant women.

## Running the Project

To run this project, clone the repository, ensure all dependencies are installed, and execute the script. Make sure the diabetes dataset is available in the specified path. The project includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions on new data inputs.

## Future Directions

- **Enhancing the Model:** Exploring other machine learning algorithms and tuning hyperparameters to improve model accuracy.
- **Expanding the Dataset:** Incorporating more diverse datasets to improve the model's robustness and applicability to different populations.
- **Deployment:** Developing a web-based application to make the diabetes prediction tool accessible to health professionals and pregnant women.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how machine learning, particularly the SVM algorithm, can be utilized to predict diabetes in pregnant women based on health metrics. By providing an accurate and reliable tool for early diagnosis, this project has the potential to significantly impact preventive healthcare during pregnancy, enhancing the well-being of mothers and their babies. Further advancements and contributions to this project could further improve its accuracy and accessibility, making it an invaluable resource for healthcare professionals and pregnant women alike.
